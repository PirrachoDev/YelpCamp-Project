ERROR:

>> ERROR TAKES YOU TO New Campground/Edit/etc

BUG:
Middleware: validateCampground
Description:
When used on the edit campground form and there's a Joi validation error, it takes you to /campgrounds/new
instead of sending you back to the same edit form

ROLES -->> FIXED
controllers/users.js

When registering we're also updating role DB adding the new user to the users array
but when using const role = await Role.find({role: req.user.role})
it does retrieve data, but doesn't allow me to trear role.users as an array since I'm trying
role.users.push(req.users._id)
but when I change to const role = await Role.findById(id) <-- hard coding const id = 'sadasda'
then it all works fine
I think it will have to do with cursos vs actual documents on MongoDB
