ERROR:
Flow:
New Campground/Edit/etc >> RenderLogin (automatic) >> ANY OTHER PAGE >> Manually Login (RenderLogin) >> 
>> ERROR TAKES YOU TO New Campground/Edit/etc

BUG:
Middleware: validateCampground
Description:
When used on the edit campground form and there's a Joi validation error, it takes you to /campgrounds/new
instead of sending you back to the same edit form

ROLES -->> FIXED
controllers/users.js

When registering we're also updating role DB adding the new user to the users array
but when using const role = await Role.find({role: req.user.role})
it does retrieve data, but doesn't allow me to trear role.users as an array since I'm trying
role.users.push(req.users._id)
but when I change to const role = await Role.findById(id) <-- hard coding const id = 'sadasda'
then it all works fine
I think it will have to do with cursos vs actual documents on MongoDB

NEXT STEPS -->> DONE!
1- When editing a user and changing its role, we have to delete the userId
 from the old role and add it to the new role
Work will take place most likely into /controllers/users.js

WORKING FRONT END--->> DONE
 Logic related to delete buttons, I want to use Bootstrap modals becauser they look good, that's 
 why I have to change the approach
 Now I have to go to the edit user page to delete a user, for the params to not get messed up
 thanks to the modals
 It's already functional but it may needs some tweaks

*WORKING FRONT END on /views/campgrounds/index.ejs -->> In progress
  implementing pagination, it's working, I have to work on the logic for bootstrap pagination at the bottom, 
  work on previous and next behaviour if there is nothing prior nor after the currentPage
  It seems like we will have to implement protection against invalid previous and next buttons on controller level, since
  someone easily can enter an invalid query (?page=0) and return an error.
  but is also recomended to do it at front end level too. Here in front end, what happends if there is only 1 page? bottom page indicators will show
  routing to undefined endpoints. CHECK THIS OUT!
  What about limit? I mean websites such as Encuentra24 let you choose how many results you want to display

SHOW USER PAGE
*We can take this website Replit example, its profile page looks good enough

BACK END --->> In progress
*Edit Role field only available if Mod or higher. (Front end is done)
*Mod cannot edit to be an admin, he can only edit from user to mod and viceversa.
*Admin can make all changes, if there is only 1 admin, this cannot be degraded to mod or user without
 having set other admin first.
