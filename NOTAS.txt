ERROR:

BUG:
Middleware: validateCampground
Description:
When used on the edit campground form and there's a Joi validation error, it takes you to /campgrounds/new
instead of sending you back to the same edit form

ROLES -->> FIXED
controllers/users.js

When registering we're also updating role DB adding the new user to the users array
but when using const role = await Role.find({role: req.user.role})
it does retrieve data, but doesn't allow me to trear role.users as an array since I'm trying
role.users.push(req.users._id)
but when I change to const role = await Role.findById(id) <-- hard coding const id = 'sadasda'
then it all works fine
I think it will have to do with cursos vs actual documents on MongoDB

NEXT STEPS -->> DONE!
1- When editing a user and changing its role, we have to delete the userId
 from the old role and add it to the new role
Work will take place most likely into /controllers/users.js

WORKING FRONT END--->> Pending
 Logic related to delete buttons, I want to use Bootstrap modals becauser they look good, that's 
 why I have to change the approach
 Now I have to go to the edit user page to delete a user, for the params to not get messed up
 thanks to the modals
 It's already functional but it may needs some tweaks

SHOW USER PAGE
*We can take this website Replit example, its profile page looks good enough

NEXT STEPS--->> In progress
*Edit Role field only available if Mod or higher.--->> DONE!
*Mod cannot edit to be an admin, he can only edit from user to mod and viceversa.
*Admin can make all changes, if there is only 1 admin, this cannot be degraded to mod or user without
 having set other admin first.
